The odin project fundamentals javascript basic final project

While working on building the calculator I've realized that I'm manually testing everytime I make a change.
I've then realized I don't know who to write tests. When looking at The Odin Porject curriculum I saw that testing will only be covered in a much later stage.
I've decided to take a small detour and learn how to test my application. I figured out I want to test both the javascript code and the UI.
After researching the subject I've decided on using Jest to test the JS functionality and Jest + Playwright to test the UI.
